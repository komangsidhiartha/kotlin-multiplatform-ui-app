# MultiplatformUIApp

This is an exploratory project to learn and demonstrate how to share code between multiple platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform. The project is based on the template generated by the Kotlin Multiplatform wizard and currently focuses on sharing code between an Android and a Desktop (JVM) application.

## Features

### Posts

This feature fetches and displays a list of posts from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API. It demonstrates the following concepts:

*   **Shared Data Layer:** The `PostModel` and `PostRepository` are defined in the `shared` module and are used by both the Android and Desktop apps.
*   **Shared Presentation Layer:** The `PostViewModel` is also in the `shared` module and contains the business logic for fetching and managing the list of posts.
*   **UI Layer:** The UI for Android and Desktop is built with Compose Multiplatform and is shared between them. The `PostListScreen` and `PostItem` composables are defined in the `composeApp` module. The iOS app, on the other hand, uses a native SwiftUI implementation. It features a `PostListView` that observes a `PostViewModel` to display the list of posts, demonstrating a clean MVVM architecture.
*   **Networking:** The project uses [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for making network requests and [Kotlinx Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for parsing JSON.

## Project Structure

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
    Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
    folder is the appropriate location.

* [/iosApp](./iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* [/server](./server/src/main/kotlin) is for the Ktor server application.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal. The app will display a list of posts fetched from a remote API.

- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run Desktop (JVM) Application

To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal. The app will display a list of posts fetched from a remote API.

- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```

### Build and Run Server

To build and run the development version of the server, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :server:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :server:run
  ```

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (which includes `npm`)
2. Build Kotlin/JS shared code:
   - on macOS/Linux
     ```shell
     ./gradlew :shared:jsBrowserDevelopmentLibraryDistribution
     ```
   - on Windows
     ```shell
     .\gradlew.bat :shared:jsBrowserDevelopmentLibraryDistribution
     ```
3. Build and run the web application
   ```shell
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or open the [/iosApp](./iosApp) directory in Xcode and.
